> **Learning you can touch.**

Traditional education confines learning to passive consumption — students read, watch, and forget. There is no intuitive way for learners to *physically interact* with abstract concepts, leaving critical gaps in understanding and retention. **GesturEd** bridges this by transforming hand gestures into a learning interface, making education truly hands-on.

## What is GesturEd?

GesturEd is an **AI-Native EdTech platform** that uses real-time hand gesture recognition to let students interact with and manipulate educational concepts visually — turning abstract ideas into tangible, explorable experiences.

No mouse. No keyboard. Just your hands.
